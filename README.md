# LZ-family_coder_decoder

This project is simply a console application for encoding and decoding strings using LZ algorithms.

The main goal of this project is to implement a library for encoding and decoding strings. Since the application is console and has several files, the project implemented a Makefile for assembling the application. Also added to the repository is a folder with example files for decoding.

## Technical specifications:

**make version** - 4.3 \
**g++ version** - 13.2.0

## Launch instructions

To launch the application, you need to do the following:

```
make
```

To clean the folder, you need to do the following:

```
make clear
```

## Future plans

- [x] Functions to encoding string
- [x] Functions to decoding string
